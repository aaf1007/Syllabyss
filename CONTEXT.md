# StormHacks Study Game

A study app: a student uploads their own course files, and the app turns them into games they choose the kind of. The first kind, Dive, is in the style of Krillion: timed prompts where less obvious correct answers score more. There are six: Dive, Apogee, Leap, Pairs, Blitz and Arena. Study stays private; what Players share is a public Profile and leaderboards on public Games (ADR-0005).

## Language

**Player**:
A student who uploads files and plays the Games made from them. Their Modules, Source Documents and Module Games are private; other Players see only their Profile and their places on Leaderboards.
_Avoid_: User (in game logic), contestant

**Module**:
A Player's private container for one subject: it holds many Source Documents and many Games.
_Avoid_: Course, folder, class, project

**Source Document**:
One file a Player uploaded into a Module (PDF, PPTX, DOCX), which Prompts are generated from.
_Avoid_: Upload, file, material

**Game**:
The set of Prompts generated once, in one Game Mode, from a chosen subset of a Module's Source Documents. A Game is never regenerated; to change it, the Player makes a new Game.
_Avoid_: Deck, quiz, set

**Game Mode**:
The kind of game a Game is played as, chosen when the Game is created and never changed. A Game Mode decides which kinds of Prompt the Game is generated with, the rules of its Runs, how they score, and how it looks. Game Modes may share Prompt kinds and parts of their rules.
_Avoid_: Game type, game style, mode (on its own, where it could mean something else)

**Dive**:
The first Game Mode, in the style of Krillion. A Run is 7 Prompts drawn at random, 25 seconds each; each wrong guess costs 3 seconds; running out of time scores 0 for that Prompt and the Run continues. Less obvious correct Answers score more (see Tier).
_Avoid_: Krillion mode, classic mode

**Apogee**:
A Game Mode with exactly Dive's Prompts, rules and scoring, set in space: the score is shown as altitude and the Tiers are named Troposphere, Orbit, Lunar and Deep Space.
_Avoid_: Space Dive, rocket mode

**Leap**:
A Game Mode of Multiple-choice Prompts. A Run is 10 Prompts, 15 seconds each, one answer each. A correct answer scores 100 plus a speed bonus of up to 50, times a streak multiplier (×1.5 from the third correct in a row, ×2 from the fifth). A wrong answer or a timeout costs a Heart.
_Avoid_: Quiz mode, jumper

**Pairs**:
A Game Mode where the Player matches terms to their definitions on Boards, against the clock. It uses Definition-to-term Prompts: the definition is the Prompt, the term its Answer.
_Avoid_: Matching, memory, flashcards

**Blitz**:
A Game Mode of True/false Prompts against one 60-second clock: +10 per correct answer, doubled by a Combo; a wrong answer resets the Combo and costs 3 seconds.
_Avoid_: Speed round, lightning mode

**Arena**:
A first-person Game Mode of Multiple-choice Prompts: the stem floats on a board and the 4 options are targets to shoot. A Run is 10 Prompts, 20 seconds each. Hitting the right target scores like Leap (100 plus a speed bonus of up to 50, times the streak multiplier), less 25 for each wrong target hit first (never below 25). A wrong target shatters and costs 3 seconds, and the Prompt stays open; a timeout scores 0.
_Avoid_: FPS mode, shooter, quiz

**Run**:
One play-through of a Game, by the rules of its Game Mode.
_Avoid_: Game, round, session, play

**Prompt**:
One question in a Game. The first correct Answer ends it. Which kinds of Prompt a Game uses, how they're timed and how many tries they take, depend on its Game Mode.
_Avoid_: Question, card

**Open Prompt**:
A Prompt with many valid Answers, each with its own Rarity (e.g. "Name a graph algorithm").
_Avoid_: Open set, category prompt

**Single-answer Prompt**:
A Prompt with exactly one correct Answer: fill-in-the-blank, definition-to-term, put-in-order, or odd-one-out. In Dive, the Prompt itself carries one Tier, assigned when the Game is generated.
_Avoid_: Closed prompt, fact question

**Multiple-choice Prompt**:
A Prompt with a stem and exactly 4 options, one of which is correct; that option is its Answer and the other three are plausible distractors from the same notes. Used by Leap and Arena.
_Avoid_: MCQ (in user-facing text), quiz question

**True/false Prompt**:
A statement from the notes that is either true or false (a false one changes one detail of a real fact). Its Answer is True or False. Used by Blitz.
_Avoid_: Fact check, binary question

**Hint**:
A short clue toward the Answer of a Single-answer Prompt, written when the Game is generated and never containing the Answer. In Dive, revealing it drops the points by one Tier; a hinted common Prompt is worth 5.
_Avoid_: Clue, help

**Answer**:
A response the game accepts as correct for a Prompt. It must be backed by Evidence in a Source Document.
_Avoid_: Solution, option

**Alias**:
Another accepted spelling or name for an Answer (e.g. "breadth-first search" for BFS).
_Avoid_: Synonym, variant

**Evidence**:
The page in a Source Document that supports an Answer.
_Avoid_: Citation, source

**Off-syllabus guess**:
A guess that may be true in general but has no Evidence in the Source Documents, so it is not accepted.
_Avoid_: Wrong answer (it is not necessarily wrong)

## Scoring (Dive)

**Rarity**:
An Answer's rank of obscurity among the other Answers to the same Open Prompt, set once when the Game is generated and never changed by play. Exactly one Answer per Open Prompt is rarest.
_Avoid_: Prior rarity, crowd rarity, difficulty

**Tier**:
A named points band (common 10, solid 25, deep 60, rare 100). Answers to Open Prompts get a Tier from their Rarity; a Single-answer Prompt gets one Tier for the whole Prompt.
_Avoid_: Level, rank

**Staleness**:
The halving of an Open Prompt Answer's points for each earlier Run in which the Player scored with that same Answer on that same Prompt, never below 1 point.
_Avoid_: Decay, repeat penalty

## Play (Leap, Pairs, Blitz, Arena)

**Heart**:
One of a Leap Run's 3 lives. A wrong answer or a timeout costs one; at none left the Run ends early (the Player "fell").
_Avoid_: Life, HP

**Lifeline**:
Leap's 50/50: once per Run, it removes two wrong options from the current Prompt and halves that Prompt's points.
_Avoid_: Power-up, hint (a Hint is Dive's)

**Board**:
One round of Pairs: 6 terms and their 6 definitions, shown shuffled, with its own 60-second clock. A Pairs Run is 2 Boards. A mismatch costs 10 points and 2 seconds; clearing a Board early scores 5 per second left.
_Avoid_: Level, grid, round

**Hit**:
In Arena, shooting a target: it counts as answering with that option. A wrong Hit shatters the target; only the right Hit ends the Prompt. Shots that hit no target don't count.
_Avoid_: Shot (a shot can miss), guess

**Combo**:
Blitz's count of correct answers in a row. Once it reaches 5, each further correct answer scores double; a wrong answer resets it.
_Avoid_: Streak (that's Leap's multiplier, and the daily habit), chain

**Pass**:
A finished Run that meets its Game Mode's pass bar: Dive and Apogee score at least 150; Leap gets at least 7 of 10 right without falling; Pairs clears both Boards; Blitz scores at least 150; Arena gets at least 7 of 10 right. Courses use it to unlock the next Topic.
_Avoid_: Win, clear, complete

## Progress

**Personal Best**:
The Player's highest Run score on a Game. On a public Game it is also the Player's entry on that Game's Leaderboard.
_Avoid_: High score, ranking

**Mastery**:
The share of a Game's Answers the Player has ever found.
_Avoid_: Progress, completion

## Sonar (docs/architecture/sonar.md)

**Sonar**:
The study coach, shown as a pixel dolphin buddy. It reads the Player's Concept mastery, explains their mistakes and recommends what to play next. It runs between Runs, never during one, and never invents a number.
_Avoid_: Tutor, assistant, chatbot, the AI

**Concept**:
One skill a Prompt tests, such as `range` or `comparison_ops`. Concepts form a prerequisite graph, and each belongs to one Topic. Python Basics has 22; each Prompt is tagged with 1–3 of them.
_Avoid_: Skill, knowledge component, tag (a tag links a Prompt to a Concept)

**Concept mastery**:
The probability a Player knows a Concept, worked out from their own guesses (`p`). `pEff` is `p` after forgetting: it halves every 72 hours since the Concept was last seen. The status (mastered, learning, weak, unseen) comes from `pEff`.
_Avoid_: Mastery (that is a Game's share of Answers found), score, level

**Blame**:
How much one missed Prompt counts against each Concept it tests. A miss on a Prompt with several Concepts blames the weaker ones more.
_Avoid_: Fault, error weight

**Root cause**:
A weak or learning prerequisite of the Concepts a Player keeps missing that holds at least 40% of the blame on their last 10 misses. It is what Sonar tells the Player to fix first.
_Avoid_: Weak spot (UI copy only), underlying problem

**Top pick**:
An action the planner ranked (one of the top 3: a Concept and a Practice Game to play). **Sonar's pick** is a Game Sonar chose itself instead; it needs a reason and must pass the server's check (the Game exists, the Player can play it, its Topic isn't locked). Action cards are labelled with which one they are.
_Avoid_: Suggestion, recommendation (for the card label)

## Social (ADR-0005, docs/architecture/social.md)

**Profile**:
What other signed-in Players can see about a Player: Username, display name, avatar, Level, XP, Rank, Streak, Badges, activity heatmap, counts and best scores on public Games. Never anything inside a Module.
_Avoid_: Account, user page

**Username**:
A Player's unique public handle (3–20 lowercase letters, digits or underscores), shown as @username and used in `/u/[username]`. Derived from Clerk on first visit; the Player can change it.
_Avoid_: Handle, login, user id

**XP**:
Points earned for playing, separate from any Run's score: every finished Run (score ÷ 5, 5 to 200), passing a Topic, finishing a Course, playing the Daily Dive. Each event earns XP once.
_Avoid_: Points (that's a Run's score), experience

**Level**:
Where a Player's total XP puts them: Level n starts at 50·(n−1)·n XP (Level 2 at 100, Level 3 at 300, Level 4 at 600 …).
_Avoid_: Tier (that's an Answer's points band), rank

**Rank**:
The ocean title for a range of Levels: Plankton (1–2), Shrimp (3–4), Reef Fish (5–7), Dolphin (8–11), Orca (12–16), Leviathan (17+).
_Avoid_: Place (a Leaderboard position), Tier

**Streak**:
How many Vancouver days in a row the Player has finished at least one Run, counting today once it's played (until then, up to yesterday).
_Avoid_: Combo (that's within a Run)

**Badge**:
A named achievement a Player earns once and keeps (First Dive, Trench Diver, a Topic badge …).
_Avoid_: Achievement, trophy, medal

**Friend**:
Another Player who accepted your friend request (or whose request you accepted). Friends scope the Leaderboards; there is no chat.
_Avoid_: Follower, contact

**Public Game**:
A Game any signed-in Player can play, unlike a Module's Games, which only their owner can. Course practice Games and the Daily Dive are Public Games, owned by the app (the system Player) rather than by a Player. Each Player's Runs, Personal Best and Mastery on one are their own, and it has a Leaderboard.
_Avoid_: Shared game, global game

**Leaderboard**:
Players ordered on one measure: a public Game's counted Run score (ties go to the earlier finish), XP earned this week, or Course Topics passed. Shown Global or Friends-only. A Player's position on it is their **Place**.
_Avoid_: Ranking, high-score table

## Courses (docs/architecture/courses.md)

**Course**:
A public learning path that ships with the app (the first is Python Basics): an ordered list of Topics anyone can read and any signed-in Player can follow. No Player owns it, and it is unrelated to a Player's own Modules.
_Avoid_: Module (that's a Player's private container), class, track

**Topic**:
One step of a Course: a reading (pages of notes, which practice Answers cite as Evidence), learning resources (links), and one Practice Game per Game Mode. Topic 1 is open; each later Topic unlocks once a Practice Game of the Topic before it is Passed. Marking the reading as read is optional and unlocks nothing.
_Avoid_: Lesson, chapter, unit

**Practice Game**:
A Public Game attached to a Topic, built from that Topic's reading. A Topic has at most one per Game Mode, and Passing any of them Passes the Topic.
_Avoid_: Exercise, quiz

## Daily Dive (docs/architecture/daily-dive.md, ADR-0006)

**Daily Dive**:
The once-a-day shared Dive: every America/Vancouver day one Daily Puzzle goes live at midnight, the same for every Player. Each Player gets one Counted Run per day; the day's Leaderboard, crowd stats and share grid come from Counted Runs. Daily #1 was 2026-10-04.
_Avoid_: Daily challenge, daily quiz

**Daily Puzzle**:
One day's Daily Dive: a Public Dive Game of 7 Prompts (three Open, then one of each single-answer kind) played in a fixed order, with its Fact Sheet. It waits in the pool until it is given a day, and becomes playable (live) on that day. Its number is "Daily #N".
_Avoid_: Daily game (it is a Game, but say Daily Puzzle when you mean the day's entry)

**Fact Sheet**:
The Source Document that comes with a Daily Puzzle: seven short pages, page N stating every accepted Answer of Prompt N. It is the Evidence for the puzzle's Answers, written with the puzzle and checked by a separate verification step.
_Avoid_: Answer key, source notes

**Counted Run**:
A Player's first Run of a Daily Puzzle that finishes on that puzzle's day. It is the one that goes on the day's Leaderboard, earns Daily XP and the share grid, and feeds the crowd stats. Only one per Player per day.
_Avoid_: Official run, attempt

**Practice Run**:
Any other Run of a Daily Puzzle: a replay the same day, or a past day's puzzle played from the archive. It earns normal Run XP but never counts for the day.
_Avoid_: Replay (fine in UI copy, but say Practice Run in code and docs)

**Guest**:
A signed-out visitor who plays the Daily Dive. A Guest is not a Player: their Runs are kept, but they never appear on a Leaderboard and earn no XP, streak or badges. Signing up later does not carry a Guest's Runs over.
_Avoid_: Anonymous player, visitor (in game logic)
