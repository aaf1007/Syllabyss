-- F07: daily guess stats per Player per Game, for the Game page's accuracy-over-time chart.
-- A continuous aggregate over the guess_events hypertable: TimescaleDB keeps it up to date in
-- the background, so the chart reads a few rows per day instead of every guess.
--
-- * Days are Vancouver days. UTC days would split an evening of play
--   in two at 5 pm.
-- * materialized_only = false (real-time aggregation): rows newer than the last refresh are
--   computed from guess_events at query time, so a Run shows up on the chart right away.
-- * WITH NO DATA, because migrations run inside a transaction. The policy fills it in.
-- * Never refresh it by hand with a NULL end (refresh_continuous_aggregate(..., NULL, NULL)):
--   that materializes today, and later guesses today stay hidden until tomorrow. Use
--   now() - interval '1 minute' as the end, like the policy.
